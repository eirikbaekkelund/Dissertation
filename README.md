# Solar PV Nowcasting Using Gaussian Process Regression

This project implements a nowcasting model for solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation using Gaussian process regression. The goal of the project is to improve the accuracy of short-term (2-8 hour) forecasts of solar PV power output, which is essential for balancing the power grid and integrating more renewable energy sources into the grid.
